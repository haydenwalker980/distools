# Distools
Very customizable Discord bot written in Discorb.

## Pardon the dust!

Distools is undergoing a massive rewrite. It'll still be open source, it'll just be able to do more.

## Development Quickstart

- You need Discorb installed, `gem install discorb`
- Run `bundle install`
- Copy .env.sample to .env, and fill in the values (only TOKEN and CLIENT_ID are required)
- After that, `discorb setup`.
- Modify `main.rb` and its variables (soon to be config/names.rb, config/perms.rb) to what you want
- `bin/start` and enjoy.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the Distools project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://gh.windev.systems/hwalker/distools/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
